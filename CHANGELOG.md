# Genesis Workbench — Changelog

## Unreleased — Genomics: PRS + ancestry/population-structure PCA

Two new `genomics` submodules, both Spark/Glow-native (same modality as `gwas`; no PLINK / `pgsc_calc`),
added to the genomics submodule list so each is deployable on its own
(`--only-submodule prs/prs_v1` / `--only-submodule pca/pca_v1`).

**Compute split (serverless-first):** each job isolates Glow to a single `ingest_vcf` step on a classic
cluster (Glow is a JVM Spark extension and can't run on serverless) that writes a plain dosage Delta table;
all downstream logic (scoring / PCA) reads that table and runs on **serverless** — no Glow, no user RDD.

### New `prs/prs_v1` — Polygenic Risk Scoring

- Scores every sample in a VCF against a **PGS Catalog** scoring file:
  `PRS = Σ dosage_of_effect_allele × effect_weight`. Reads the VCF with Glow
  (`glow.genotype_states`), joins to the scoring file on `(chrom, pos)`, orients dosage to the **effect
  allele** (`effect==alt → dosage`, `effect==ref → 2−dosage`; allele mismatches and missing genotypes
  dropped), sums per sample, and standardizes within the cohort (z-score + percentile).
- `prs_initial_setup_job` downloads one harmonized GRCh38 PGS Catalog scoring file (default `PGS000004`)
  into the new `prs_reference` volume; `prs_scoring` job writes `prs_scores_<run>`. Workflow registered as a
  batch model. Dependency-free unit test of the allele-orientation math in `tests/test_prs_scoring.py`.

### New `pca/pca_v1` — Ancestry / population-structure PCA

- Per-sample principal components from a cohort VCF (the covariates a GWAS should adjust for — `gwas`
  currently runs unadjusted). Keeps biallelic common SNPs (MAF cutoff), mean-imputes/centers, and fits
  `pyspark.ml.feature.PCA` with the matrix oriented **variants-as-rows × samples-as-features** so the
  covariance is `N×N` (samples², small) regardless of variant count — distributed across variant rows, no
  driver blow-up, no RDD. Per-sample coordinates read from `model.pc` → `pca_components_<run>`
  (`sample_id, PC1..PCk`).
- `pca_compute` + `pca_initial_setup_job`; workflow registered as a batch model. NumPy-only reference test in
  `tests/test_pca_reference.py` (PC1 separates a synthetic two-population cohort).

## v2.2.0 (2026-06-22) — KERMT 2.0 live out-of-the-box · MCP server hardened (UI + MCP grants) · fresh-install & cloud-portability fixes

A consolidation release that makes the **MCP server** dependable as a first-class surface, ships **KERMT 2.0**
serving the moment it deploys, and closes a set of fresh-install / multi-cloud correctness gaps across the
small-molecule and genomics modules. Wheel `genesis_workbench` 0.1.32 → 0.1.35; no breaking changes.

### KERMT 2.0 — new submodule, live out of the box

- **New `kermt/kermt_v2` submodule** (NVIDIA-BioNeMo **NV-KERMT-70M-v2 / Contrastive KERMT**), added to the
  `small_molecule` submodule list so it's deployable on its own (`--only-submodule kermt/kermt_v2`). The
  NaN-sanitize collator patch (ClinTox salts/mixtures → NaN RDKit descriptors) is re-applied to the v2 source.
- **Fine-tune + deploy at init.** The submodule deploy now runs **register → fine-tune → deploy** in sequence,
  so a fresh install automatically fine-tunes on the bundled **TDC ClinTox** sample and stands up the
  `kermt_admet` serving endpoint with no manual UI step. The deploy step falls back to the **latest active
  `ft_id`** from `kermt_weights` when none is passed (also makes the deploy job runnable standalone). The UI
  fine-tune/deploy flow remains for bringing your own assay. (This adds a GPU fine-tune to the deploy, so it
  runs longer.) `kermt_admet.md` updated to document the automatic path.

### MCP server hardened

The companion `mcp-genesis-workbench` server is now reliable end-to-end and correctly governed:

- **MCP app SP granted everywhere the UI SP is.** Endpoint grants already read `DATABRICKS_APP_NAMES`
  (UI + MCP); job grants did not. Every module's job-registration notebook now sets `DATABRICKS_APP_NAMES`
  before `set_app_permissions_for_job`, fed by a new `databricks_app_names` register-job parameter
  (default `genesis-workbench:mcp-genesis-workbench`) — covering kermt v1/v2, genmol, enzyme, alphafold,
  rapidssinglecell, scanpy, and genomics (gwas/vcf/variant_annotation), plus bionemo. `set_app_permissions_for_job`
  switched from `set_permissions` (REPLACE) to additive `update_permissions`, so re-registering one module can
  no longer clobber a sibling app's grant. Net: deploy any module on any workspace and **both** the UI and MCP
  SPs get `CAN_MANAGE_RUN` durably.
- **Correct capability contracts.** Endpoint capability contracts are aligned to the deployed models' actual
  signatures, and `execute_capability` now applies parameter defaults so `dataframe_records` payloads are
  complete.
- **Test harness.** A new MCP test harness (`mcp_app/scripts/test_mcp_server.py`) exercises the server's tools
  end-to-end.

### Vortex

- **Animated "accretion vortex" empty-canvas backdrop** for first-run Vortex (`VortexEmptyState`).
- **Wiring sees through shape-preserving transforms** when resolving extract paths — a transform that doesn't
  change a value's shape no longer hides the upstream source from the path resolver.

### Fresh-install & cloud-portability fixes

- **`node_catalog` published on fresh install.** `core/deploy.sh` now runs `publish_node_catalog_job` on a
  fresh install (previously only `update.sh` did), so the Vortex executor and MCP server — which read the
  `node_catalog` table directly — see a populated catalog from the first deploy.
- **DiffDock — concurrent endpoint deploys + 2h wait.** `02_import_model_gwb.py` launches both the ESM
  embeddings and DiffDock scoring deployments before waiting, then waits for both together (bounded by the
  slower deploy); each wait timeout raised 1h → 2h.
- **GenMol — cloud-portable cluster availability.** GenMol hardcoded `aws_attributes: ON_DEMAND` in its base
  resources with no Azure/GCP overlay. Moved to per-target `aws/azure/gcp_attributes` overrides in
  `databricks.yml` (the kermt/diffdock pattern) for all three jobs; validated for prod_aws/azure/gcp. Also
  dropped the hardcoded, workspace-specific GenMol app SP id — `CAN_MANAGE_RUN` is granted by app name at
  registration time.

### Docs

- Refreshed the README **architecture diagram**.

### Notes

- Verified on ci-demo. No new external model beyond KERMT v2; no schema/breaking changes. Wheel 0.1.32 → 0.1.35
  (with `app/requirements.txt` + `mcp_app/requirements.txt` refs bumped in step).

## v2.1.0 (2026-06-12) — Vortex: deterministic wiring + Past Vortex Runs (inspect · re-run · failure triage)

A large batch making **Vortex** (AI-assisted workflow canvas) reliable end-to-end: workflows now wire
**deterministically** from a published contract instead of LLM guesswork, and a new **Past Vortex Runs**
surface lets you inspect, re-run, and triage any run.

### Deterministic wiring (the headline)

Vortex runs kept failing because the published contract had port *dtypes* but not output *value shapes*,
so the LLM guessed extraction paths (`[0].sequence`) that resolved to `null` at runtime.

- **Output-value shapes in the contract.** Each output `Port` now declares a `shape` (`scalar` / `list` /
  `list_obj` / `map`) + element/field dtypes, published to the `node_catalog` Delta table. `reshape_path()`
  (in the wheel) turns *(source shape → target dtype)* into a deterministic `_dig` path — no guessing.
- **Resolve-or-bridge-or-reject at submit.** Every `extract_field` is rewritten to the derived path; when a
  value can't be produced directly, the resolver **auto-inserts the unique catalog node that bridges it**
  (e.g. `enzyme.candidates` map<pdb> → **ProteinMPNN** → sequence, tie-broken to an atomic endpoint over a
  batch design chain), or **rejects the run with a plain-English reason** if none exists. No node-specific
  hardcoding — it walks the catalog by dtype/shape.
- **Envelope→port mapping.** Batch-job adapters return `{<port>: value, child_run_id, job_run_id}`; the
  orchestrator now maps that onto the node's declared output ports (was nesting the whole envelope under one
  port, which broke every downstream extract — enzyme `candidates` and molecule `top_k` alike).
- Fixed `proteinmpnn.sequences` shape (it returns a *list*), and the enzyme `motif_residues_csv` parser now
  tolerates `1` / `A:50` / `B1` (trailing integer) instead of crashing on `int('B1')`.

### Past Vortex Runs — inspect, re-run, triage

- New **Past Vortex Runs** tab (right side of the Home tab bar, history icon): browse/filter + refresh.
- **Result viewer** with **Workflow · Inputs · Outputs** tabs: a read-only canvas colored by per-node
  status (green=passed, **amber+pulse=running**, red=failed, grey=**pending** while running / **skipped**
  once failed), the exact inputs/params that fed the run, and per-node + final outputs (the empty
  `output_sink` duplicate row is suppressed). Each run shows its elapsed time ("Took …" / "Running for …").
- **Re-run with edited inputs** — a side drawer seeded from the run lets you change any input/param and
  dispatch a fresh run (original untouched), reusing the canvas's field editors.
- **Failure triage** — a write-up names the failed step + error; an **AI analysis** panel gives the root
  cause, a fix, and a **data-vs-system verdict** beside the trace. For job-backed steps, "**Examine the
  child job**" pulls the job's real stack trace (the orchestrator captures it at failure since the app SP
  can't always read the inner job; ANSI-stripped); in-process failures show the error + AI inline.

### Notes

- Frontend + app-service + orchestrator + wheel (`genesis_workbench` 0.1.27→0.1.32); no new model/module.
- Verified on ci-demo: protein-design→thermostability completed (Tm 54.4 °C); enzyme→fold→solubility now
  generates a runnable ProteinMPNN-bridged graph; failure triage shows the real `ValueError` + AI verdict.

## kermt_admet (2026-06-08) — KERMT: fine-tunable GNN ADMET model, served side-by-side with ChemProp

Added **KERMT** (NVIDIA-BioNeMo *Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task*, Apache-2.0) as a fine-tunable small-molecule
ADMET/tox model — a new `modules/small_molecule/kermt/kermt_v1` submodule plus the full app vertical. A
user fine-tunes KERMT from GROVERbase on a SMILES+target assay, deploys the result as a serving endpoint,
and the **ADMET & Safety** tab shows KERMT's prediction next to ChemProp's (the TEDDY/SCimilarity
side-by-side pattern). Closes the long-parked "ADMET upgrade / KERMT" backlog item.

### How it's built (decisions)

- **No custom container — the ChemProp pattern on classic GPU compute.** KERMT is vendored at a pinned
  commit and `%pip`-installed on a classic A10 (`15.4 gpu-ml`, py3.11) job; the BioNeMo container exists
  only because BioNeMo ships container-only, which doesn't apply here.
- **Lazy-import patch for `cuik_molmaker`.** KERMT hard-imports `cuik_molmaker` (conda-only, not on PyPI)
  at module top, but every actual use is behind the `--use_cuikmolmaker_featurization` flag. We guard the
  3 top-level imports (à la the proteina `remove_openbabel` fix) so KERMT runs **pip-only on the plain
  RDKit featurization path** for *both* fine-tune and serving — which keeps the Model Serving env buildable
  (avoids the GenMol serving-load saga).
- **In-process PyFunc serving.** The deploy job wraps a fine-tuned checkpoint in an MLflow PyFunc that
  loads the model once and predicts in-process (plain RDKit), returning the exact ChemProp ADMET contract
  (`inputs=[smiles] → predictions=[{task: val}]`) so the ADMET service reuses its existing query path.
- **Batch-workflow pattern for fine-tune.** Dispatch pre-creates the MLflow run (`feature=kermt_finetune`),
  the orchestrator advances `job_status` (`submitted→training→complete/failed`), and `RunSearchSection`
  shows it. The dispatch service resolves the job by name + queries `kermt_weights` via existing gwb
  helpers — **no new library module / version bump** (avoids the app-env-reinstall 502 risk).
- **NaN-sanitize the collator.** ClinTox salts/mixtures produce NaN/inf RDKit-2D descriptors that, with
  `--no_features_scaling`, propagated to NaN model outputs (`roc_auc_score: Input contains NaN`); the
  vendored collator now `np.nan_to_num`s them. Also pass `--warmup_epochs < epochs` (epochs==warmup zeroed
  the LR-decay denominator → NaN LR).

### Operational notes

- GROVERbase weights are **OneDrive-only and not anonymously curl-able** (401/403) — pre-stage
  `grover_base.pt` to `/Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/kermt/pretrained/` once; the register job is
  skip-if-exists with an overridable `grover_base_url`.
- Default fine-tune sample = **TDC ClinTox** (validated: test AUC 0.922). The KERMT endpoint scale-to-zero
  cold start is ~1 request; warmed predictions return in seconds.

### Verified on ci-demo

Register/stage (kermt_weights + ClinTox sample), ClinTox fine-tune (AUC 0.922, kermt_weights row +
checkpoint + MLflow `complete`), deploy (`gwb_demo_kermt_admet_endpoint` READY, `model_deployments` row),
live endpoint predicts in the ChemProp shape, settings/batch_models/app-perms provisioned.

## genmol_py311_deploy (2026-06-08) — Guided Molecule Design (GenMol), Inverse Folding, larger GPU endpoints, MLflow + UX consistency

A batch of small-molecule, large-molecule, and app-wide improvements.

### New workflow — Guided Molecule Design (Small Molecule)

Added **GenMol** (`nvidia/NV-GenMol-89M-v2`, NVIDIA Open Model License) as a small-molecule **generator**, closing the "where do candidate ligands come from?" gap, and wrapped it in a closed-loop **Guided Molecule Design** tab:

- **Generate → score → reseed loop.** GenMol grows a seed scaffold (or a binding motif resolved from a gene) into K candidates per iteration; each is scored on QED (RDKit) + ClinTox/ADMET (Chemprop); survivors reseed the next round.
- **Hard constraints, not weights.** Users specify desired values — **Min QED** and **Max ClinTox** — and only molecules satisfying both are kept ("feasible"). This replaced the earlier weight-sliders objective (mirrors the way Guided Enzyme Optimization takes explicit limits per axis).
- **Optional docking-in-reward.** Supply a target gene/sequence → the target is folded (ESMFold) and candidates docked (DiffDock) so predicted binding joins the reward.
- **Graceful "no candidates" handling.** The job never fails when nothing meets the constraints — the View shows the reward trajectory, the full explored-molecule table, and a bold *"No candidates could be found"* message; the loop reseeds from the least-violating molecules.
- **Full MLflow capture + Search Past Runs** from the start: run pre-created at submit (appears in search immediately), `job_status` lifecycle, per-iteration reward metrics, all input params (incl. `qed_min`/`tox_max`/`target_gene`), and `top_k.json` (`{top_k, explored}`) + `trajectory.json` artifacts.
- Runs on a **classic DBR 15.4 LTS (Python 3.11)** cluster + endpoint — GenMol hard-pins `pandas==2.1.0`/`transformers==4.52.4`, which fail to build on serverless py3.12.
- New feature doc: [`guided_molecule_design.md`](modules/core/app/backend/documentation/guided_molecule_design.md).

### New workflow doc — Inverse Folding (Large Molecule)

The ProteinMPNN backbone→sequence tab (each design validated by re-folding with ESMFold) now logs its designs to an MLflow run (`gwb_inverse_folding`, `designs.fasta`/`designs.json`/`backbone.pdb` artifacts) and initializes default Experiment/Run names like the other workflows. New feature doc: [`inverse_folding.md`](modules/core/app/backend/documentation/inverse_folding.md).

### Larger GPU serving endpoints

- **AlphaFold long-sequence OOM fix.** The fold step OOM'd above ~1300 aa on T4; moved to an **A10** endpoint with **JAX unified memory** (`TF_FORCE_UNIFIED_MEMORY`) spilling to host RAM. A10 alone is insufficient at 1863 aa (BRCA1) — unified memory is required.
- **ESMFold and RFdiffusion → `GPU_MEDIUM` (A10).** Human-scale proteins were exhausting T4 16 GB. Re-running the register jobs builds the A10 container cleanly and cuts over (an in-place `workload_type` config update times out on container creation, so re-register is the reliable path).

### Protein search now covers human proteins

Sequence Similarity Search queries the human `gene_sequence_embedding_index` (over `gene_sequences`, ESM-2 1280-dim) **together with** the UniRef `sequence_embedding_index`, so a single query returns both human and broad-organism hits (previously human queries surfaced only microorganisms).

### MLflow + UX consistency

- Runs appear in **Search Past Runs immediately after submit** across all workflows (run pre-created with `job_status=submitted`; URI pinned to Databricks tracking so runs no longer intermittently vanish).
- **Uniform progress bars** (emoji-block style) across every Search Past Runs view; AlphaFold search drops the Sequence column (no horizontal scroll) and renders in-progress bars correctly.
- **AI Interpretation is the final progress stage** — the scGPT perturbation narrative now runs inside the main progress flow, and results reveal only once the narrative settles.
- The **AI-generated disclaimer** ("Generated by … — verify against the data") is now rendered **bold + yellow** in a callout box so it's easy to notice, everywhere AI Interpretation is shown.

### Bug fix — stuck "Paste from Clipboard" popover

A wrapping `<label>` forwards dead-area clicks to its first labelable descendant — where that was a ClipboardPaste/sequence-picker button, clicking the field's label area (or a label stretched tall by a sibling `<select>`) re-opened the popover and blocked the page. Converted the affected wrapper `<label>`s to `<div>`s across PerturbationTab, GuidedMoleculeOptimizationTab, AdmetSafetyTab, LigandBinderDesignTab, and ProteinDesignTab.

## proteina_no_openbabel (2026-05-22) — Drop GPL-2.0 Open Babel from the Proteina-Complexa serving environment

Removed Open Babel (GPL-2.0) from the GWB Proteina-Complexa endpoints. Two related changes:

1. **Submodule deletion.** `modules/small_molecule/open_babel/` is gone. It registered as the `open_babel_converter` model but was never called from any app code; `utils/small_molecule_tools.py:smiles_to_pdb` does SMILES→PDB via RDKit (BSD-3) using `AllChem.EmbedMolecule(ETKDGv3) + MMFFOptimizeMolecule`. The stale help text in `ligand_binder_design.py:48` ("…will be converted to PDB via Open Babel") is corrected to point at RDKit.

2. **Proteina-Complexa pinned to NVIDIA's `remove_openbabel` branch.** `modules/small_molecule/proteina_complexa/proteina_complexa_v1/notebooks/01_register_proteina_complexa.py` now clones at SHA `f95f2d4bbcebcad0613b89a0012edec8637a6334`. That commit drops the unconditional `from atomworks.ml.transforms.openbabel_utils import ...` in `proteinfoundation/datasets/atomworks_ligand_transforms.py` and replaces the `use_openbabel=True` codepath with `NotImplementedError`. The `use_rdkit_from_smiles` and `use_bonds_from_file` paths are untouched. `openbabel-wheel` is removed from both pip-install lines in the notebook (the driver-side install and the conda_env spec served to the endpoint container).

### Why this was needed

The first attempt at removing `openbabel-wheel` from just the conda_env succeeded at registration but exploded on the first endpoint invocation: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openbabel'`. Trace: `proteinfoundation/datasets/gen_dataset.py:15` unconditionally imports `atomworks_ligand_transforms`, which imports `atomworks/ml/transforms/openbabel_utils.py`, which does `from openbabel import openbabel, pybel` at module top. Even with no openbabel functions actually called in the GWB invocation path, the import was a hard module-load failure. The NVIDIA team published a `remove_openbabel` branch that severs this import; that's what we pin to.

### Why GWB's invocations are GPL-clean even though Proteina has a `use_openbabel=True` codepath

`ProteinaComplexaLigandModel.predict` (line 530) and `ProteinaComplexaAMEModel.predict` (line 599) build `LigandFeatures(..., use_bonds_from_file=True)` and never set `use_openbabel=True`. The `NotImplementedError` introduced by the upstream branch fires only when `use_openbabel=True`; GWB's two ligand-aware variants stay in the RDKit-backed file-bonds path. The protein-protein binder variant doesn't construct `LigandFeatures` at all.

### Verification

- Bundle deploy: SUCCESS at 2026-05-21 21:05:53
- Registration job (run_id `830465540994892`): SUCCESS at 22:05:32 (60 min, all three variants logged in a single `for variant_key in MODELS.items()` loop)
- UC model versions, all `READY`: `proteina_complexa` @ 21:48 UTC, `proteina_complexa_ligand` @ 21:49 UTC, `proteina_complexa_ame` @ 21:50 UTC
- Predict-time smoke test on the stored input example (the one that previously raised `ModuleNotFoundError: openbabel`): passes

### Upgrade hazard for future bumps

The SHA pin is intentional. Before bumping to a newer Proteina commit (especially if NVIDIA merges `remove_openbabel` into `main`/`dev` and starts iterating), grep the target SHA for any top-level `from openbabel ...` or `from atomworks.ml.transforms.openbabel_utils ...`. If they come back, the GPL coupling has been reintroduced and the pin should not be bumped. Encoded as a feedback memory at `~/.claude/.../memory/feedback_proteina_no_openbabel.md`.

## teddy_annotation (2026-05-20) — Merck TEDDY-G 400M joint cell-type + disease annotation

Added Merck's [TEDDY-G 400M](https://huggingface.co/Merck/TEDDY) (Apache 2.0) as a foundation model for single-cell biology. Workflow #1 is **joint cell-type + disease annotation** on the existing UMAP tab — TEDDY runs side-by-side with SCimilarity, both checkboxes default ON. New submodule: `modules/single_cell/teddy/teddy_g_v1`. New feature doc: [`modules/core/app/docs/single_cell_teddy_annotation.md`](modules/core/app/docs/single_cell_teddy_annotation.md).

### Why 400M and not 70M

The public TEDDY-G ships as encoder-only (`n_cls=0`, no classification head). GWB wraps the encoder in a serving endpoint that returns per-cell embeddings, then performs KNN annotation against a 2 M-cell CELLxGENE Census reference Delta + Vector Search index. Initial implementation used 70M for cost. On inspection, the 70M encoder placed an NK-cluster representative at cosine 0.98 to plasma cells on a `scanpy_20260507_1950` run that was unambiguously NK by marker genes — meaning KNN retrieval could not distinguish the two cell types. The TEDDY paper validates zero-shot retrieval only on the 400M variant. Variant size is **not** a cost knob for this workflow; 400M is now the default and `teddy_model_size` should not be lowered.

### Reference build — multinode pandas_udf on 8× A10

The 2 M-cell reference embed is a `mapInPandas` job on a multi-node GPU cluster (`job_cluster_teddy_a10_multinode`), not the single-node A10 used in earlier revisions:

- **8 workers × 1× A10 + A10 driver, on-demand.** `spark.task.resource.gpu.amount=1` pins one task per GPU.
- Each Spark worker loads TEDDY-G 400M from the UC volume once per process, opens its own `cellxgene_census` handle, fetches X for its partition via `get_anndata(obs_coords=...)`, embeds at batch=48 with bf16 autocast, yields embeddings. GPU-side `torch.topk` over the 60,530-gene matrix.
- Wall-clock: ~3 h 15 min for 2 M cells. Full DAG (register → endpoint deploy + extract gene mapping || reembed → create VS index) ~5 h 18 min end-to-end on the validated build.

### The 256-partition bug — root cause for a prior 9 h trajectory

First multinode attempt didn't finish in 12 h. The bug:

```python
n_partitions = max(spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism, ceil(n_cells / 50_000))
```

`defaultParallelism` on a 4× g5.16xlarge cluster is 256 (4 nodes × 64 vCPU). That produced 256 partitions of 7,812 cells each. With `task.resource.gpu.amount=1`, only 4 ran concurrently — each GPU processed 64 partitions sequentially, and each partition's `get_anndata(obs_coords=<7,812 scattered joinids>)` triggered hundreds of S3 random point reads in TileDB-SOMA. Net: ~9 min/partition × 64 partitions per GPU = 9.6 h per GPU.

The fix is two changes:

1. **Sort the obs sample by `soma_joinid` and use `repartitionByRange("soma_joinid", N)`** — each partition gets a contiguous joinid range, so Census reads are sequential S3 instead of random point reads.
2. **Hard-floor partition count at the GPU worker count (not `defaultParallelism`).** Target ~5 partitions per GPU → 40 partitions of 50k cells each on the 8-GPU build.

Don't use `defaultParallelism` as a floor on GPU-bound mapInPandas jobs. It will produce a partition count proportional to CPU count, which is orders of magnitude larger than the GPU count and serializes everything through the GPU bottleneck.

### Endpoint, wrapper, idempotency, destroy

- **Serving endpoint** `gwb_teddy_endpoint` deploys on **GPU_MEDIUM (A10)**, not GPU_SMALL. 400M weights + seq=2048 attention activations don't fit T4 16 GB reliably.
- **bf16 autocast** in both the wrapper (`teddy_wrapper.py:_forward`) and the reembed UDF — halves attention activation memory and roughly 2× the throughput on A10. Activations stay in fp32 by default; only the math goes bf16.
- **Dim-aware idempotency** in both notebook 03 and notebook 04. A re-deploy on an already-built reference exits in seconds. A variant switch (70M → 400M) is detected via `dim != expected_dim` and triggers a clean rebuild (drop + recreate Delta, drop + recreate VS index — sync can't change index dim).
- **Destroy preserves `teddy_cells`, `gwb_teddy_vs_endpoint`, `teddy_cell_index`.** These are created procedurally inside the notebooks, NOT declared as bundle resources — `databricks bundle destroy` cannot touch them. `destroy.sh` prints an explicit "PRESERVED / REMOVED" list at the top to make this visible. This mirrors the SCimilarity destroy policy.

### Documentation hard rule encoded in skills

Every new GWB feature must ship three doc artifacts in the same PR: a `modules/core/app/docs/<module>_<feature>.md` page, a root-README bullet under the matching module, and a CHANGELOG entry. Encoded as "Documentation (hard rule)" in `claude_skills/SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_DEVELOPMENT.md` (alongside Dependency hygiene + On-demand compute) and as a sixth verification step in `SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_BATCH_WORKFLOW_PATTERN.md`. The TEDDY entry above is the first feature shipped under the new rule.

### Reference implementations to mirror for the next single-cell foundation model

- `modules/single_cell/teddy/teddy_g_v1/notebooks/03_reembed_reference.py` — multinode pandas_udf + sorted partitioning + GPU topk for any Census-backed reference build.
- `modules/single_cell/teddy/teddy_g_v1/notebooks/04_create_teddy_vs_index.py` — dim-aware VS index recreate-or-sync.
- `modules/core/app/views/single_cell_workflows/processing.py` — side-by-side annotation UI pattern (model checkboxes default-ON, both predictions logged to the same MLflow run).

### The app-side debug arc — four cascading bugs that all presented as "every cluster predicts glutamatergic neuron"

After the reference and endpoint were healthy, the first end-to-end app test on a COVID-19 PBMC dataset returned IDENTICAL predictions (`glutamatergic neuron (19%); intestinal epithelial cell (16%); unknown (12%)`) for every one of seven biologically distinct clusters (monocytes, NK, DC, platelet, erythrocyte). Same percentages to two decimal places across all clusters. Four independent bugs had to be unearthed, each layered behind the previous:

1. **HVG matrix triggered embedding collapse.** Initial code path fed `hvg_matrix.parquet` (~2000 genes, ~96 % zero per cell) to TEDDY. With the wrapper's uniform attention mask, the zero-tied filler positions (identical across cells via PyTorch's topk tie-break in gene-index order) dominated the embedding. Swap: prefer `markers_flat.parquet` (~68 genes, ~40 % non-zero per cell — matches TEDDY's pretraining signal density). HVG re-enable requires per-cell attention masks on both query and reference, plus a reference rebuild.

2. **`DEV_USER_PREFIX` env var wasn't bound in the deployed app.** Every endpoint-name lookup in the app code base (`teddy_tools._get_endpoint_name`, `scimilarity_tools._get_endpoint_name`, `streamlit_helper.get_endpoint_name`) was constructing `gwb_{DEV_USER_PREFIX}_{suffix}_endpoint`. The variable was declared in `module.env` and `variables.yml` but never bound into the app's runtime env via `resources/app.yml`. So the app tried `gwb_teddy_endpoint` (without the `demo` prefix) which 404'd. Quick fix: bind the variable through a new secret-scope entry. **Real fix** (refactor): every endpoint lookup now goes through `genesis_workbench.models.get_endpoint_name_for_uc_model(short_name)`, which reads from the `model_deployments` table — the single source of truth that `deploy_model_endpoint()` writes at deploy time. The env-var derivation pattern was an architectural mistake; the table was always there.

3. **POSIX `open()` doesn't work on `/Volumes/` paths in Databricks Apps.** `teddy_tools._load_gene_mapping` used `open("/Volumes/.../gene_mapping.json")` — which works in notebooks (DBR mounts the volume via FUSE) but silently raises `FileNotFoundError` in the app sandbox (no FUSE mount). The exception was caught → mapping stayed empty → `_translate_gene_names` returned HGNC symbols untranslated → TEDDY's tokenizer mapped every gene to `<unk>` → every cell's input became identical → every embedding became identical → every cluster predicted the same "default" cell type. The notebook-vs-app divergence was the smoking-gun symptom: same code, same data, same endpoint, but different outcome based purely on caller identity (which is really about FUSE access). Fix: use `WorkspaceClient().files.download(path)` — the same pattern already in `processing._load_gmt` for GMT files. Identical bug class to the existing "Apps need WRITE VOLUME for uploads" note in `enzyme_optimization`.

4. **Pip cached the stale wheel after the refactor (and `update.sh` had a macOS portability bug).** After adding `get_endpoint_name_for_uc_model` to the library and redeploying, the deployed app's `.venv` still imported the old wheel (`ImportError: cannot import name 'get_endpoint_name_for_uc_model'`). Cause: pyproject.toml version stayed `0.1.0` — pip's resolver saw the wheel already installed at 0.1.0 and skipped reinstall. Bumped to `0.1.1`. Separately, `update.sh:70` used `echo -e "\nlib/..." >> requirements.txt` to append the new wheel dependency. On macOS's `/bin/echo`, `-e` is not honored — the literal string `"-e \nlib/..."` got written to `requirements.txt`. Pip then failed with `ERROR: -e requires a source location`. Fix: switched the line to `printf "\nlib/%s\n" "$filename"`.

Each of these would have been hard to catch alone; together they masked one another. The arc is preserved in feedback memories (`feedback_apps_volume_filesapi.md`, `feedback_endpoint_lookup_from_table.md`, `feedback_lib_version_bump.md`) so future contributors don't re-derive the lesson under pressure.

### Architectural takeaway: source of truth for endpoint names

The `model_deployments` table (populated by `deploy_model_endpoint()`) is the canonical source of truth for serving endpoint names. The new `get_endpoint_name_for_uc_model(short_name)` helper queries it lazily with a per-process cache. The `DEV_USER_PREFIX` env-var-based construction pattern remains in dead code only in `enzyme_optimization_tools.py` where it's passed as a **job parameter** (not a runtime lookup) — that use is fine and untouched. Everywhere else, prefer the table lookup.

## guided_enzyme_creation (2026-05-07) — Phase 1.6: Batch-workflow pattern + Variant Annotation per-run tables

### Batch-workflow pattern, formalized

The "form → job → MLflow → search past runs → result dialog" shape that AlphaFold, Disease Biology (GWAS / Variant Annotation), and Scanpy already used is now an explicit, named pattern — and Guided Enzyme Optimization has been retrofitted onto it. New skill file `claude_skills/SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_BATCH_WORKFLOW_PATTERN.md` codifies the five layers (orchestrator job, registration, dispatcher, search past runs, result dialog) with the canonical reference being the enzyme-optimization stack. `CLAUDE.md` adds a row pointing to it.

This is the third pass on this pattern. Each retrofit fixed a real bug from the prior shape:

- **MLflow run is pre-created from the dispatcher** (Disease-Biology pattern, now adopted by enzyme_optimization). Without it, cluster cold-start + `pip install` (3–5 min on the Accurate path) leaves *Search Past Runs* empty even though the job is in flight. The dispatcher tags `origin=genesis_workbench`, `feature=enzyme_optimization`, `created_by=<user>`, `job_status=submitted`, logs `generation_mode` + scaffold/sample/iteration params, then passes the new `mlflow_run_id` job parameter so the orchestrator attaches via `mlflow.start_run(run_id=...)` instead of creating its own.
- **Dispatcher returns `(job_id, job_run_id)` not `(job_id, run_id)`.** They are different things — the int job-run id versus the hex MLflow run id — and conflating them is what broke MLflow artifact retrieval in earlier passes. The launch view now shows the `job_run_id` and a "View Run" button; *Search Past Runs* discovers the MLflow run via tags.
- **Inline auto-polling result pane is gone.** Replaced with the AlphaFold-style success-message + *Search Past Runs* dialog. The dialog renders a live composite-reward chart, top-K candidates table, per-candidate Mol* viewer, eight-metric grid, and PDB download. New module-level helpers (`_is_viewable_status`, `_set_selected_enzyme_opt_run_status`, `_display_enzyme_opt_result_dialog`) keep the dialog decorator usable; the search helpers (`search_enzyme_optimization_runs_by_experiment_name`, `search_enzyme_optimization_runs_by_run_name`) live in `enzyme_optimization_tools.py`.
- **New `register_enzyme_optimization_job` notebook + DAB resource.** Without it the app SP doesn't have `CAN_MANAGE_RUN` and `WorkspaceClient().jobs.list(name=...)` returns empty from the app context — the dispatcher errored with "Orchestrator job '...' not found." Pattern matches the existing `register_*` notebooks.

### Apps-sandbox-safe UC volume writes

`_write_motif_pdb_to_volume` (the helper that persists the user's motif PDB before dispatching the job) used to do `os.makedirs(...) ; open(path, "w")`. That works in a Databricks notebook, but Databricks Apps run in a sandboxed container that does **not** have POSIX access to `/Volumes/...` — `open(...)` raises `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Volumes'`. Switched to the SDK's Files API (`WorkspaceClient().files.upload(...)`) which uploads via the workspace's UC backend with the app SP's auth and auto-creates intermediate directories. Same pattern is now the canonical "write to a volume from a Databricks App" recipe.

`grant_app_permissions.py` correspondingly grants `WRITE VOLUME` (in addition to `READ VOLUME`) on the schema to the app SP — without it the SDK upload still 403s.

### `dataframe_records` everywhere for serving endpoints

All four developability endpoints (NetSolP / PLTNUM / DeepSTABp / MHCflurry) and ProteinMPNN V8 require the `dataframe_records=[{...}]` payload shape. The legacy `inputs=...` shape gets rejected by MLflow's schema enforcement as either "extra inputs: ['index', 'columns', 'data']" (when split-orient) or as a tensor mismatch. Updates:

- `enzyme_optimization_tools.py:_query_predictor` switched to `dataframe_records` and now passes a list of named-column records explicitly.
- `protein_design.py:hit_proteinmpnn` rewritten to V8's two-column schema (`pdb` + `fixed_positions`, JSON-encoded). The orchestrator's broad `except` was masking the schema-mismatch as "ProteinMPNN optimization failed for N/N scaffold(s)."
- `motif_scaffolding.py:_hit_proteinmpnn` updated for the same V8 schema with `fixed_positions=""` (no motif preservation — that tab redesigns every residue).

### Default 6-allele HLA panel centralized in app

`enzyme_optimization_tools.py` now exports `_DEFAULT_MHC_ALLELES = "HLA-A*02:01,HLA-A*01:01,HLA-B*07:02,HLA-B*44:02,HLA-C*07:01,HLA-C*04:01"` (the Sette-style 6-allele panel covering ~95% of the global population), matching the default in the orchestrator's `utils.py:call_mhcflurry`. Single source of truth.

### Variant Annotation — per-run tables refactor

The variant_annotation flow used to write to global tables (`*_variants_with_pathogenic`, `*_pathogenic`, `*_annotated`) with a `run_name` discriminator column, deduped via `MERGE INTO ... WHERE run_name = ...`. Two problems: (a) Glow's VCF-INFO struct shape can drift between runs (different variants → different INFO fields), causing `MERGE INTO` schema-evolution failures, and (b) the `run_name`-only key doesn't disambiguate concurrent runs with the same name from different users.

Notebooks `01_spike_pathogenic_variants.py`, `02_filter_and_annotate.py`, and `03_save_results.py` rewritten to write to **deterministic per-run table names**: `<base>__<sanitized_run_name>_<mlflow_run_id_prefix>`. The sanitizer lowercases + collapses non-alphanumeric to `_`, caps at 40 chars; the run-id prefix is the first 8 chars of the MLflow run id. Each run owns its own three tables — Glow's struct drift can't collide across runs, concurrent runs are disjoint, and `DROP TABLE` is the cleanup story instead of `DELETE WHERE`.

App-side, `pull_annotation_results(run_id, run_name)` in `disease_biology.py` reads the new `pathogenic_table` MLflow tag/param set by `03_save_results.py` and falls back to reconstructing the name from `(run_name, run_id)` if the tag is absent (older runs).

`deploy.sh` updated; new `data/brca_pathogenic_corrected.vcf` checked in for spike-step testing.

### `deploy_model.py` — apostrophes in deployment_description

`MERGE INTO {catalog}.{schema}.model_deployments` was breaking with `PARSE_SYNTAX_ERROR` whenever a model's `deployment_description` contained an apostrophe — DeepSTABp's `"mt_mode ('Cell' or 'Lysate', default 'Cell')"` was the trigger. Added a local `_sql_escape()` helper that doubles internal single quotes; mirrors the `_sql_val` helper in `genesis_workbench/models.py`. Copy-pasted rather than imported because `deploy_model.py` runs before the `genesis_workbench` library is on the cluster's path. Numeric / identifier interpolations stay raw (trusted bundle vars or Python ints/bools).

### Single-cell processing — annotation cache UX

`processing.py:_display_results_viewer`: when loading a saved SCimilarity annotation from MLflow, real exceptions (auth, network, malformed JSON) are now stashed in `annotation_load_error_<run_id>` and surfaced as a yellow `st.warning(...)` so the user knows whether to retry or annotate fresh. The "artifact absent" case stays silent — the *Annotate Clusters* button is the right action.

Bigger fix: when overlaying annotation labels onto the UMAP, the original cluster column is no longer mutated. Mutating it fed back into a subsequent `annotate_clusters` call (which reads `df[cluster_col].unique()`) and compounded the label, e.g. `"0 - classical monocyte"` → `"0 - classical monocyte - classical monocyte"` on the second annotation pass. The annotated labels now live in a sibling column `<cluster_col> (annotated)`.

### Workflow diagrams

New rendered workflow images for the in-app `documentation/enzyme_optimization.md` page: `enzyme_optimization_workflow_fast.{mmd,png,svg}` and `enzyme_optimization_workflow_accurate.{mmd,png,svg}` (plus a generic `enzyme_optimization_workflow.{mmd,png,svg}`). The .md doc embeds the PNGs at the top of each mode's section so the help-page reader can see the topology before reading the prose.

## guided_enzyme_creation (2026-05-06) — Phase 1.5: Generation-mode toggle (Fast / Accurate)

### New: Fast vs Accurate generation modes for Guided Enzyme Optimization

The Guided Enzyme Optimization form gained a **Generation mode** radio (Fast / Accurate, default Fast). The toggle picks where the reward signal is applied: between iterations (Fast) or *during* the diffusion process (Accurate).

- **Fast (~30 min, no GPU cost)** — unchanged from Phase 1.4. AME runs as a Databricks Model Serving endpoint, the loop scores K candidates after generation, parents are resampled by reward for the next iteration. Job: `run_enzyme_optimization_gwb` on a CPU cluster.
- **Accurate (~30-60 min, ~$22 GPU cost)** — new. AME loads on an A10 GPU cluster (checkpoints pulled from the registered UC model `{catalog}.{schema}.proteina_complexa_ame`, version resolved from the GWB `models` table). Uses Proteina-Complexa's Feynman-Kac steering: at intermediate denoising steps, partial structures are scored via our `DevelopabilityCompositeReward(BaseRewardModel)` and trajectories are importance-sampled, so losing branches get pruned early and surviving compute lands on developability-promising candidates. Job: `run_enzyme_optimization_gwb_inprocess_ame` on an A10 GPU cluster.

Verified end-to-end on K=4, N=2, all-axes-weight-1.0 with the catalytic-triad smoke motif: Fast `iter_mean=0.449`, Accurate **`iter_mean=0.506`** — first signal that FK-steering's importance-weighted resampling concentrates reward more uniformly across the batch. iter_max is in the same range across both modes.

### Architecture

Both jobs share the same orchestrator notebook (`01_run_optimization.py`); the dispatcher (`enzyme_optimization_tools.py:_resolve_orchestrator_job_id(use_inprocess_ame)`) picks the right job by name based on the toggle. The notebook reads `use_inprocess_ame` at top, runs `install_proteinfoundation_if_needed()` + `dbutils.library.restartPython()` *before* any torch-touching imports (the Databricks runtime ships its own torch — installing torch 2.7.0 alongside leaves torch_scatter referencing the wrong C++ symbols and crashing on first use), then either calls `call_ame()` (Fast) or `run_ame_with_rewards()` (Accurate) per iteration.

`DevelopabilityCompositeReward` inherits from `proteinfoundation.rewards.base_reward.BaseRewardModel`. Its `score(pdb_path, requires_grad=False, **kwargs)` extracts the AA sequence from the candidate PDB and calls our four developability endpoints (NetSolP / PLTNUM / DeepSTABp / MHCflurry) in series, applying the half-life anchor sigmoid to PLTNUM. Per-axis fallback: any failed endpoint contributes 0 instead of crashing the search. The reward is attached via `model.reward_model = reward` directly (not via `inf_cfg.reward_model` / Hydra) — `Proteina.configure_inference()` only takes `(inf_cfg, nn_ag)`.

### AME checkpoints from UC, not NGC

The Accurate path pulls AME checkpoints from the registered UC model `{catalog}.{schema}.proteina_complexa_ame` (whichever version is `is_active=true` in the GWB `models` table). No NGC fallback — if the proteina_complexa submodule isn't deployed in this workspace, `_fetch_ame_checkpoints_from_uc(...)` raises with a clear "deploy proteina_complexa first" message. Re-deploys are bit-reproducible because the UC version is the same .ckpt blob the proteina_complexa registration baked.

### Endpoint warmup at job start (both paths)

The orchestrator pre-warms NetSolP / PLTNUM / DeepSTABp / MHCflurry (`warmup_developability_endpoints`) and AME / ESMFold / ProteinMPNN (`warmup_generation_endpoints`) with one dummy call each before the loop starts. Without it, scale-to-zero cold starts of 5-20 min mid-loop bust the request timeout. The Fast-path AME call's `_query` timeout was also raised: 600s → **1800s** (AME cold start observed at >20 min); default `_query` timeout for the developability endpoints raised 600s → **1200s**.

### Phase 1.4 motif chain bug, fixed

A latent bug in the Phase 1.4 ProteinMPNN call: orchestrator passed `fixed_positions={target_chain: motif_residues}` where `target_chain` was the input motif's chain (typically "B"), but AME emits scaffolds on chain **"A"**. Upstream's `tied_featurize` KeyError'd on the chain mismatch; the orchestrator's broad `except` swallowed the error; motif preservation silently no-op'd every iteration. Fixed by hardcoding `AME_OUTPUT_CHAIN="A"` and making the fall-through warning loud (`⚠️ MOTIF PRESERVATION DID NOT RUN for this candidate.`).

### Pinning + on-demand compute pattern alignment

- All proteinfoundation transitive deps are now exact-pinned in a versioned `enzyme_optimization_v1/notebooks/proteinfoundation_requirements.txt` (35 packages — torch==2.7.0 to align with PyG cu126 wheels, accelerate==0.34.2 for transformers 5.5.0 compat, biotite==1.4.0 because atomworks 2.2.0 hard-pins it, plus 30 more). The proteinfoundation upstream itself is pinned via `git clone --branch dev` with the resolved SHA logged at install time.
- Both enzyme_optimization jobs (Fast + Accurate) are configured for **on-demand** compute on every cloud — `availability: ON_DEMAND` / `ON_DEMAND_AZURE` / `ON_DEMAND_GCP` overlaid via per-cloud `targets:` in `databricks.yml`, matching the canonical pattern in `boltz/boltz_1/databricks.yml`. Spot-instance reclamation killed two consecutive verification runs at 13 and 35 min; the rule is now codified in `claude_skills/SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_DEVELOPMENT.md` (new "On-demand compute (hard rule)" section).

### Files added / modified

| Path | Change |
|---|---|
| `modules/small_molecule/enzyme_optimization/enzyme_optimization_v1/resources/run_optimization.yml` | New `run_enzyme_optimization_inprocess_ame` job resource (A10 GPU). Both jobs gained `use_inprocess_ame`, `fk_n_branch`, `fk_beam_width`, `fk_temperature`, `fk_step_checkpoints` job params. |

AME `call_ame` timeout 600s → 1800s. Default `_query` timeout 600s → 1200s. |
| `…/notebooks/01_run_optimization.py` | Early-install cell at the top reads `use_inprocess_ame`; if true, installs proteinfoundation deps and `dbutils.library.restartPython()` before any torch-touching code. Job-start warmup of all 8 endpoints on both paths. `AME_OUTPUT_CHAIN="A"` for ProteinMPNN motif preservation. |

## guided_enzyme_creation (2026-05-05)

### New: Guided Enzyme Optimization workflow

A new "Guided Enzyme Optimization" tab under Small Molecules — a reward-weighted resampling loop around the Motif Scaffolding stack (Proteina-Complexa-AME + ProteinMPNN + ESMFold). Each iteration scores K candidates on motif backbone RMSD, ESMFold pLDDT, optional Boltz substrate complex confidence, and four developability axes (solubility, half-life, thermostability, immunogenicity), composes a weighted composite reward, logs everything to MLflow, then biases the next iteration toward high-reward parents.

The half-life axis is **anchor-based**: the user supplies one or more reference enzymes with measured half-life; the loop sigmoids each candidate's PLTNUM relative-stability score against `min(reference) + margin`, turning a relative ranker into a defensible "predicted at least as long-lived as your reference, with margin" signal.

A **strategy interface** is shipped now so Phase 2 can drop in `EvolutionaryStrategy` (mutate top-K with ProteinMPNN's fixed-positions mode) without touching the orchestrator core. Phase 1 implements `ResampleFromAMEStrategy` (default) and `NoOpStrategy` (verification).

### New predictor submodules under `modules/small_molecule/`

- `netsolp/netsolp_v1/` — NetSolP-1.0 distilled, BSD-3-Clause. ONNX Runtime CPU endpoint. Tiny dep tree (`onnxruntime`, `fair-esm`). Weights bundled in `weights/` (extracted once via `weights/extract_weights.sh` from the upstream tarball; ~30 MB, BSD attribution preserved alongside).
- `pltnum/pltnum_v1/` — PLTNUM-ESM2, MIT. Half-life relative-stability ranker on ESM-2 650M. GPU_SMALL endpoint. Weights auto-pull from HuggingFace `sagawa/PLTNUM-ESM2-NIH3T3`. The `PLTNUM_PreTrainedModel` class is vendored inline in the registration notebook with attribution.
- `deepstabp/deepstabp_v1/` — DeepSTABp, MIT. Tm regression in °C. ProtT5-XL backbone (~3 GB, MIT verified at parent ProtTrans repo) auto-pulls from HuggingFace; the 80 MB MLP head pulls from the upstream GitHub raw URL. GPU_SMALL endpoint.
- `mhcflurry/mhcflurry_v2/` — MHCflurry 2.2.1, Apache-2.0. MHC-I peptide-presentation predictor wrapped as a sliding-9-mer scan with a default 6-allele HLA panel (~95% global coverage), aggregated to a per-residue "immunogenic burden" score. CPU endpoint. Weights via `mhcflurry-downloads fetch` at registration time.

### New orchestrator submodule

- `enzyme_optimization/enzyme_optimization_v1/` — Databricks job that runs the loop on a CPU cluster (all heavy work delegated to endpoints). 24h timeout cap. Parameters mirror `start_scanpy_job`. The job is dispatched on demand by the Streamlit page, not auto-run at deploy time.

### Boltz SDK timeout fix

`modules/core/app/utils/protein_design.py:hit_boltz` now uses a long-timeout `WorkspaceClient(config=Config(http_timeout_seconds=600))` and accepts a `timeout_seconds` kwarg (the optimization loop passes 900s for ligand complexes). Same incident pattern that bit SCimilarity earlier — the Databricks SDK's 60s default was killing Boltz cold starts on `GPU_SMALL`.

### Motif RMSD utility

`modules/core/app/utils/structure_utils.py` gained `motif_backbone_rmsd(input_pdb_str, designed_pdb_str, motif_residues, ...)` — thin Bio.PDB.Superimposer wrapper for the optimization loop's structural fidelity axis. Uses the existing `select_and_align` helpers; no new file.

### App side

- New `modules/core/app/utils/enzyme_optimization_tools.py` — `start_enzyme_optimization_job` (mirrors `start_scanpy_job` shape, dynamic job-ID lookup by name since `RUN_*_JOB_ID` env vars aren't actually wired up in this repo), `predict_enzyme_properties` (single-sequence smoke test across all four developability endpoints, used by the form's "Test on T4 lysozyme" button), `load_optimization_trajectory` / `load_top_k_pdbs` / `get_run_status` for the polling view.
- `modules/core/app/utils/streamlit_helper.py:_MODEL_ENDPOINT_MAP` updated with the four new display-name → UC-name mappings (`netsolp_v1`, `pltnum_v1`, `deepstabp_v1`, `mhcflurry_v2`).
- `modules/core/app/views/small_molecules.py` — new `enzyme_opt_tab` between Motif Scaffolding and ADMET; renders `enzyme_optimization.render()`.

### Documentation

- README per-module dependency table extended with NetSolP, PLTNUM, DeepSTABp, MHCflurry rows (every pin + license + upstream source); "Inside Genesis Workbench" line lists all four developability predictors.
- New in-app help: `modules/core/app/documentation/enzyme_optimization.md` with full inputs/outputs/pipeline + the honest caveats (half-life is anchor-relative, not hours; first iteration is uniform; etc.).
- `claude_skills/SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH.md`, `SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_WORKFLOWS.md` updated with the new workflow.
- `claude_skills/SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_DEPLOY_WIZARD.md` documents the new per-submodule deploy order and the one-time NetSolP weight-population step.
- `claude_skills/SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_DESTROY_WIZARD.md` adds a note on the new `small_molecule` submodule list and on NetSolP's git-bundled weights surviving destroy.
- `claude_skills/SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_DEVELOPMENT.md` gains a top-level **Dependency hygiene** section codifying the exact-pin rule applied to every new pip dep introduced in this branch.

---

## version_pinning (2026-04-20 → 2026-05-05)

### Version pinning across modules
- Exact-pinned every pip dependency in registration notebooks (`pkg==X.Y.Z`); removed `latest`/range specifiers. Includes torch, torchvision, tensorflow, transformers, scimilarity, and others.
- Removed hardcoded `aws_attributes` from submodule bundles; now driven entirely by per-target overrides in each module's `databricks.yml`.

### SCimilarity refactor — VS-backed similarity search
- Externalized the 23M-cell reference from the in-memory MLflow `SearchNearest` PyFunc into a Delta table (`scimilarity_cells`) + Databricks Vector Search index (`scimilarity_cell_index`). The deprecated `register_SearchNearest_task` is removed from the job graph.
- New notebooks: `06b_extract_reference_to_delta.py` (writes embeddings + metadata in 1M-row batches) and `06c_create_cell_vector_index.py` (creates VS endpoint + Delta Sync index, polls until ready).
- App-side `search_nearest_cells()` queries the VS index and joins back to the Delta table for `prediction`/`disease`/`tissue`/`study`. No per-request PyFunc endpoint in the loop.
- Bugfixes from end-to-end testing: `06b` per-batch `reset_index(drop=True)` (without it, only the first 1M rows had populated metadata); `06c` distinguishes `NotFound` vs transient API errors and tolerates `sync_index` 400 when a sync is already running.
- SCimilarity cache volume created out-of-band in `deploy.sh` (alphafold pattern); removed from `volumes.yml` so `bundle destroy` doesn't blow away the 12 GB Zenodo download.

### Deploy / destroy ergonomics
- New `--only-submodule <path>` flag on root and aggregator `deploy.sh` / `destroy.sh` for surgical per-submodule operations (e.g. redeploy only `scimilarity` without touching `scanpy`/`scgpt`/`rapidssinglecell`). Atomic modules reject the flag with a clear error.
- New skill files: `claude_skills/SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_DEPLOY_WIZARD.md` and `SKILL_GENESIS_WORKBENCH_DESTROY_WIZARD.md`. Destroy wizard codifies "core last" ordering and the new policy: do **not** delete VS endpoints/indexes by default — preserving them turns a 5+ hour re-sync into a fast incremental on the next deploy.
- `update.sh` now bootstraps the `genesis_workbench_secret_scope` and the two app-required secrets (`core_catalog_name`, `core_schema_name`) the same way `deploy.sh` does, so app deploys don't fail with `Invalid secret resource ...`.
- `destroy_module.py` gained an optional VS cleanup block (currently commented out, for opt-in only when a fully clean slate is wanted).

### Reliability
- `register_boltz` and `register_esmfold` raised from 1 h → 2 h on both the task `timeout_seconds` and the inner `wait_for_job_run_completion(...)` poll, so weight downloads + endpoint provisioning don't false-fail.

### UI
- Removed page-level CSS injection in `single_cell_workflows/processing.py` that bumped *all* tabs on the Single Cell page to `1.1rem / 500` — the parent tab strip now matches the other modules' default Streamlit tab styling.

---

## development (2026-04-11/13)

### Protein Studies — New workflows

- **Boltz Structure Prediction**: Added Boltz as a third structure prediction model alongside ESMFold and AlphaFold2 in the Structure Prediction tab. Supports multi-chain complexes (protein-protein, protein-ligand with SMILES input). Uses the already-deployed Boltz endpoint with proper input formatting (`protein_A:SEQUENCE`).
- **Inverse Folding with ProteinMPNN**: New standalone tab where users paste a PDB backbone and ProteinMPNN designs multiple sequences that fold into that structure. Selectbox to browse designs, auto-validates each with ESMFold and displays the predicted structure. Includes a default PDB (ubiquitin fragment) for immediate testing.

### Single Cell — New workflows

- **Cell Type Annotation via SCimilarity**: Automatic cluster annotation using the 3 SCimilarity endpoints (GeneOrder, GetEmbedding, SearchNearest) against a 23M-cell reference database. Generates cell embeddings in batches, searches nearest neighbors, majority-vote prediction per cluster. Displays annotation table + UMAP colored by predicted cell type. Includes progress bar with spinner.
- **Cell Similarity Search**: Standalone tab to search the 23M-cell reference for cells similar to a selected cluster. Shows neighbor cell type distribution (bar chart), disease distribution (bar chart), study sources, and full results table.
- **Differential Expression Viewer**: Pairwise DE between any two user-selected clusters in the results viewer. Mann-Whitney U test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Interactive volcano plot with labeled significant genes and sortable results table.
- **Pathway Enrichment Analysis**: Enrichr-based GO/KEGG/Reactome enrichment of cluster marker genes via gseapy. Bar chart of top enriched pathways and full results table with overlap, p-values, and gene lists.
- **Trajectory / Pseudotime Analysis**: Optional diffusion pseudotime computation added to both Scanpy and rapids-singlecell (part of scverse) processing pipelines (new "Compute Pseudotime" checkbox). Results viewer shows UMAP colored by pseudotime and gene expression along pseudotime with LOWESS trendline.
- **Gene Perturbation Prediction (scGPT)**: New scGPT perturbation model for zero-shot prediction of gene knockout/overexpression effects. New registration notebook (`03_register_scgpt_perturbation.py`), deployment notebook (`04_import_perturbation_gwb.py`), and job YAML tasks. UI tab with gene selector ranked by cluster expression, perturbation type radio, bar chart of top affected genes, scatter plot (original vs predicted), and summary metrics.

### Deployment optimizations

- **SCimilarity**: Smart skip when model files already exist in Volume (saves 60+ min on re-deploy). Parallel model + sample data downloads via ThreadPoolExecutor. Quiet wget/tar output. CPU nodes for wget and GeneOrder job clusters instead of GPU (cost savings).
- **scGPT**: Skip model/data downloads when files already exist. Pre-load model weights in `load_context()` instead of re-reading 2-3 GB from disk on every `predict()` call. Smaller input_example (10x1500 instead of 1000x1000) for faster model logging. Force float32 dtype in perturbation model to avoid float16/float32 mismatches.

### UI consistency

- **Mol* viewer standardization**: Added dark theme CSS (`MOLSTAR_DARK_CSS`) to `molstar_tools.py` matching the small molecule viewer style. Standardized viewer dimensions to `width: 100%; height: 500px` (was hardcoded `1200px x 400px`). Switched to `loadStructureFromData` API. Uniform `components.html` height (540px) across all protein studies and small molecule views.

### Infrastructure

- **destroy.sh safety**: Changed `rm .deployed` to `rm -f .deployed` in all 7 module destroy scripts to avoid errors when file doesn't exist.
- **App permissions**: Automated `CAN_QUERY` grants on serving endpoints and `CAN_MANAGE_RUN` on jobs during deployment via `grant_app_permissions.py`.

---

## add_small_molecule_studies (2026-04-09/10)

### Home page overhaul
- **AI Assistant tab** ("What do you want to do?"): Natural language interface powered by Claude Sonnet via Databricks Foundation Model endpoint. Users describe what they want to accomplish and get guided to the right workflow with step-by-step instructions.
- **Documentation Search tab**: Full-text search across all workflow documentation (markdown files indexed at app startup)
- **Example pills**: Pre-built example questions for quick discovery (e.g., "How do I predict protein structure?", "Run a GWAS analysis")
- **Documentation**: Added markdown docs for all workflows — molecular docking, protein design, GWAS analysis, variant annotation, sequence search, single cell analysis, etc.
- **Bigger/bolder tabs**: Global CSS for larger tab labels (`1.1rem`, `font-weight: 600`)
- **User settings caching**: Cached in session state to avoid re-fetching on every rerun
- **LLM endpoint**: Configurable via `LLM_ENDPOINT_NAME` env var, added to `app.yml` resources with `CAN_QUERY` permission

### DiffDock — Confidence model fix
- Fixed `'HeteroDataBatch' has no attribute 'complex_t'` error by building a separate confidence dataset using `InferenceDataset` with confidence model parameters — matches the pattern in `01_register_diffdock_wo_esm.py`
- Updated example PDB in UI from 3-residue stub to 50-residue excerpt from PDB 6agt (fetched at runtime)
- Added step-by-step progress bar (ESM embeddings → DiffDock scoring → results) replacing single spinner

### Disease Biology — New module
- **GWAS Pipeline**: Parabricks `fq2bam` + `haplotypecaller` (split from single `pbrun germline`), `--low-memory` flag, real-time log streaming, input file validation, BWA index download
- **VCF Ingestion**: VCF-to-Delta via Glow, auto-generated output table names (`vcf_ingested_{timestamp}`), output table logged as MLflow tag for downstream lookup
- **Variant Annotation**: ClinVar annotation with gene panel filtering (BRCA1/BRCA2, ACMG SF v3.2 81-gene panel via BED file, or custom regions), Lakeview dashboard with auto-updated catalog/schema references (fixed `lakeview.update` SDK API to use `Dashboard` object)
- **Parabricks**: Fixed Python 3.12 pip incompatibility (`python -m ensurepip`), separate `%sh`/`%pip` cells, reference genome download switched from FTP to HTTPS, downloads to local disk then copies to Volume
- **GWAS Analysis cluster**: Changed from single-node to 4-worker multi-node for parallel processing
- All disease biology init workflows use MERGE INTO for idempotent settings inserts
- Sample VCF download fixed: FTP→HTTPS, Python-based download with validation instead of `%sh wget`
- GWAS results: Graceful handling of all-NULL pvalues with clear user message

### MLflow job status tracking
- Created `modules/core/notebooks/update_mlflow_status.py` — lightweight serverless notebook for setting `job_status` tag
- Added `mark_success` / `mark_failure` tasks (using `depends_on` with `outcome: SUCCEEDED/FAILED`) to all 5 job workflows: parabricks_alignment, gwas_analysis, vcf_ingestion, variant_annotation, alphafold
- Search results now derive status from `job_status` tag which is reliably set by completion tasks
- Added visual progress column to search results with blinking orange dots for in-progress, green for complete, red for failed

### Sequence Search — New workflow
- **Download**: UniRef90 FASTA download with skip-if-exists
- **Delta tables**: Batch FASTA parsing (500K records/batch), skip if table has >100 rows
- **Batch embedding**: Switched from GPU `pandas_udf` to `ai_query()` via deployed ESM2 serving endpoint — eliminates GPU cluster dependency. GPU notebook preserved as `03_batch_embed_sequences_gpu.py` backup. Limited to 1M sequences.
- **Vector index**: Fixed SDK API (`EndpointType.STANDARD`, `EmbeddingVectorColumn`, `endpoint_status`), enabled Change Data Feed on source table
- UI: Moved Sequence Search to second tab position (after Settings)
- Added `parasail` to app requirements for Smith-Waterman alignment

### Settings page improvements
- **Deployed Endpoints section**: Shows real-time status using served entity deployment state (🟢 Ready, 🟡 Starting, ⚪ Scaled to zero, 🔴 Failed). Cached in session state with manual refresh button.
- **Deployed Modules section**: Shows all non-job settings from settings table
- **Start All Endpoints**: Added `CAN_MANAGE` permission in `app.yml`, REST API for run status check
- **Registered Workflows**: Spinner during loading

### UI / UX improvements
- Mol* viewer: Fixed SDF loading by converting to HETATM PDB records, switched to `loadStructureFromData` API with correct 3-parameter signature
- Ligand Binder Design: Docked ligand view options only shown when valid SDF exists
- Disease Biology search: Default search text initialized to "gwas"
- VCF Ingestion → Variant Annotation auto-populate: "From VCF Ingestion" pill selector
- Protein Design: Auto-generated run name with timestamp
- All inline imports moved to page top

### Infrastructure fixes
- `databricks-sdk==0.50.0` and `databricks-sql-connector==4.0.3` pinned in sequence search notebooks
- `cloudpickle==3.0.0` pinned to match ESM2 model registration environment
- `app.yml`: Added `start_all_endpoints_job` with `CAN_MANAGE` permission, LLM endpoint with `CAN_QUERY`
- Removed `ServingModelWorkloadType` dependency (class removed in newer SDK)

---

## add_small_molecule_studies (2026-04-05)

### Start All Endpoints feature
Added ability to start all deployed model serving endpoints and keep them alive for a configurable duration (1–12 hours). Useful for demos where endpoints must not scale to zero.

- **New notebook**: `modules/core/notebooks/start_all_endpoints.py` — queries `model_deployments` for active endpoints, retrieves `input_example` from MLflow model registry, starts endpoints via REST API, and pings them every 15 minutes using parallel requests
- **New job**: `modules/core/resources/jobs/start_all_endpoints.yml` — DAB job definition (max 1 concurrent run)
- **Settings UI**: Added "Endpoint Management" tab in Settings with a duration picker and "Start All Endpoints" button. Detects if a keep-alive job is already running and shows estimated end time instead of allowing a duplicate launch
- **Wiring**: Job ID stored in `settings` table as `start_all_endpoints_job_id`, loaded into env by `workbench.initialize()`, passed through `initialize_core.yml` → `initialize_core.py`

### Small Molecule — new model sub-modules

#### DiffDock
Added [DiffDock](https://github.com/gcorso/DiffDock) molecular docking model as a new sub-module (`diffdock/diffdock_v1`). DiffDock uses diffusion generative modeling to predict 3D binding poses for protein–ligand complexes, with a score model (reverse diffusion) and a confidence model to rank predicted poses.

- **New sub-module**: `modules/small_molecule/diffdock/diffdock_v1/` — full DAB bundle with `databricks.yml`, `variables.yml`, `deploy.sh`, `destroy.sh`
- **Job resource**: `register_diffdock.yml` — dedicated GPU cluster (DBR 14.3 LTS ML GPU, A10G single node) for checkpoint download and model registration
- **Volume**: `volumes.yml` — managed UC volume for DiffDock artifact caching
- **Notebook**: `01_register_diffdock.py` — installs DiffDock + PyG extensions, clones DiffDock repo, computes ESM embeddings, runs inference to pre-download model weights, defines `DiffDockModel` PyFunc wrapper with lazy loading (to avoid 300s serving timeout), registers to UC via `mlflow.pyfunc.log_model`, imports into GWB and deploys serving endpoint
- **Key design**: Lazy model loading in `DiffDockModel.predict()` — defers heavy ESM2 and DiffDock score/confidence model loading until first prediction call to circumvent model serving endpoint startup timeouts
- **Artifacts bundled**: DiffDock repo, ESM2 weights (~2.5 GB), score model, confidence model — all packaged as MLflow artifacts to prevent re-downloading during serving
- Updated parent `modules/small_molecule/deploy.sh` and `destroy.sh` to include `diffdock/diffdock_v1` in the module loop

#### Proteina-Complexa
Added NVIDIA [Proteina-Complexa](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/Proteina-Complexa) protein binder design models as a new sub-module (`proteina_complexa/proteina_complexa_v1`). Proteina-Complexa is a generative flow-matching model that designs novel protein binders for protein targets, small-molecule ligands, and scaffolds functional motifs — all in a fully atomistic manner.

- **New sub-module**: `modules/small_molecule/proteina_complexa/proteina_complexa_v1/` — full DAB bundle with `databricks.yml`, `variables.yml`, `deploy.sh`, `destroy.sh`
- **Job resource**: `register_proteina_complexa.yml` — dedicated GPU cluster (DBR 15.4 ML GPU, A10G single node) for NGC checkpoint download and multi-model registration
- **Volume**: `volumes.yml` — managed UC volume for checkpoint caching
- **Notebook**: `01_register_proteina_complexa.py` — installs proteinfoundation + PyG extensions + transitive deps (atomworks, graphein, openfold, etc.), downloads 3 sets of checkpoints from NGC, defines base `_ProteinaComplexaBase` PyFunc class with 3 variant subclasses, registers all 3 models to UC, imports each into GWB and deploys serving endpoints
- **3 model variants registered**:
  | Model | UC Name | Use Case |
  |-------|---------|----------|
  | `proteina-complexa` | `proteina_complexa` | Protein-protein binder design |
  | `proteina-complexa-ligand` | `proteina_complexa_ligand` | Small-molecule ligand binder design |
  | `proteina-complexa-ame` | `proteina_complexa_ame` | Motif scaffolding with ligand context |
- **Code bundling**: Stages `proteinfoundation`, `openfold`, and `graphein` as `code_paths` — avoids broken build from graphein's invalid PEP 440 specifier and openfold's missing Python 3.12 support
- **NGC checkpoint patch**: Patches `concat_pair_feature_factory.py` to match NGC checkpoint dims (272→271) — NGC checkpoints were trained without `CrossSequenceChainIndexPairFeat`
- Updated parent `modules/small_molecule/deploy.sh` and `destroy.sh` to include `proteina_complexa/proteina_complexa_v1` in the module loop

---

### Protein Studies — deployment fixes

#### ESMFold
- Reverted registration job from serverless GPU back to dedicated GPU cluster (`15.4.x-gpu-ml-scala2.12`) — serverless env installed CPU-only torch causing CUDA driver mismatch on serving endpoint
- Added `aws_attributes: availability: ON_DEMAND` to prevent spot preemption during long registration jobs
- Reverted `databricks.yml` CLI version to `>=0.236.*`

#### Boltz
- Reverted all files to match known working commit (`8348954`): dedicated GPU cluster, `flash_attn==1.0.9`, `torch==2.3.1+cu121`, `mlflow==2.15.1`, `cloudpickle==2.2.1`
- `flash_attn==2.8.3` was incompatible with `boltz==0.4.0` (removed `flash_attn_unpadded_kvpacked_func` API)
- Added `aws_attributes: availability: ON_DEMAND`

---

## deploy/fe-vm-hls-amer (2026-03-18)

Deployment to `fe-vm-hls-amer` (AWS) — all modules verified working (51/51 checks passed).

---

### Infrastructure

#### ON_DEMAND enforcement
- 12 of 21 jobs use dedicated clusters (`job_clusters` with `new_cluster`). All 12 have `aws_attributes: availability: ON_DEMAND` in their YAMLs.
- The remaining 10 jobs run on **serverless compute** (no cluster definition) — `aws_attributes` does not apply to them.
- **Known DAB issue**: On the initial deploy, 6 of the 12 cluster-based jobs were created with `SPOT_WITH_FALLBACK` despite the YAML specifying `ON_DEMAND`. This appears to be a DAB bug where cluster config changes aren't propagated to existing jobs.
- Fixed via `databricks jobs reset` API for: `run_scanpy_gwb`, `run_rapidssinglecell_gwb`, `register_scgpt`, `register_scimilarity`, `register_proteinmpnn`, `register_rfdiffusion`
- **On fresh deploy**: Verify all cluster-based jobs have ON_DEMAND after `deploy.sh` completes. If DAB doesn't apply the setting, use `databricks jobs get <job_id>` to check and `databricks jobs reset` to fix.

#### Shared catalog GRANT
- `initialize_core.py`: wrapped `GRANT USE CATALOG` in try/except — user may not own the target catalog but `account users` may already have `ALL_PRIVILEGES`. **Fixed in code** — graceful fallback on grant failure.

#### Wheel deployment
- `deploy.sh` copies wheels to UC Volume after `databricks bundle deploy`. If the script fails mid-run, the wheel copy step may not execute. **Fixed in code** — wheel copy is now in the deploy flow with `set -e`.

#### Job tags
- `download_gene_references_gwb` was missing standard GWB tags on initial deploy. **Fixed in code** — both scanpy and rapids-singlecell (part of scverse) `download_gene_references.yml` now include `tags: application: genesis_workbench, module: single_cell`.

#### application.env
- `deploy.sh` uses `paste -sd,` which breaks on comments/blank lines. **Fixed in code** — env file cleaned of all comments and blanks. Deployers should keep env files comment-free.

#### Docker credentials
- `bionemo_docker_token` and `parabricks_docker_token` are passed as plaintext DAB variables — visible in workspace job definitions via API. **Not yet fixed.** To harden: store in secret scope and reference via `{{secrets/scope/key}}`.

#### Unused DAB experiment
- `modules/core/resources/experiments/module_registration.yml` created an empty, confusing experiment at `/Users/<user>/dbx_genesis_workbench_modules`. Commented out with explanation. Deleted from workspace.

---

### AlphaFold

#### 5-layer download failure
3 of 7 download tasks failed. Five distinct issues stacked:
1. **Spot preemption** → fixed by ON_DEMAND
2. **FTP/rsync blocked** on AWS VPC → `sed` patches FTP→HTTPS
3. **Heredoc quoting** in `%sh` cells → moved script creation to Python cell
4. **Path parsing + silent wget** → replaced recursive wget with explicit URL parsing (`curl` + `grep`) fed to `aria2c -j 16`
5. **HTML "href" prefix in regex** → fixed with `cut -d'"' -f2 | tr -d '/'`

Files changed: `download_setup.py`, `download_pdb_mmcif.py`

---

### Single Cell (scanpy + rapids-singlecell (part of scverse))

#### Dependency pins
- `scikit-learn==1.5.*` — cuml 25.10 wraps `BaseEstimator._get_default_requests` removed in newer scikit-learn
- `numpy<2` — prevents TensorFlow import failure (`numpy.core.multiarray failed to import`) on DBR 16.4 GPU ML runtime

#### App UI improvements
- **Mode-aware MLflow defaults**: Moved mode selector outside `st.form` so experiment name updates dynamically (`scanpy_genesis_workbench` vs `rapidssinglecell_genesis_workbench`)
- **Heading**: Renamed "Run Scanpy Analysis" → "Run Analysis"
- **Results viewer filter**: Default changed from `scanpy_genesis_workbench` to `genesis_workbench` — partial match shows both scanpy and rapids results

#### Gene mapping — dataset compatibility

Both `analyze_single_h5ad.py` notebooks (scanpy + rapids-singlecell (part of scverse)) have two paths for gene names:

**Path 1: `gene_name_column` is provided**
- Uses the specified column directly as gene names
- Uppercases for consistent QC (MT-, RPS, RPL detection)
- No Ensembl reference lookup — skips entirely
- Works for any dataset where a column already has gene symbols

**Path 2: `gene_name_column` is empty (default)**
- Requires `species` parameter
- Assumes `adata.var.index` contains Ensembl IDs (e.g., ENSG00000141510)
- Loads reference CSV from `/Volumes/{catalog}/{schema}/{scanpy|rapids}_reference/ensembl_genes_{species}.csv`
- Merges on `ensembl_gene_id` to get `external_gene_name`
- Falls back to Ensembl ID if no match

**Dataset compatibility:**

| Dataset type | gene_name_column | species | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ensembl IDs as index (e.g., 10x CellRanger) | (empty) | hsapiens/mmusculus/rnorvegicus | Standard path, uses reference mapping |
| Gene symbols as index (e.g., Adams) | `row_names` | (ignored) | After reset_index, symbols land in `row_names` |
| Gene symbols in a named column | column name (e.g., `gene_name`) | (ignored) | Direct column reference |

**Potential improvements (not yet implemented):**
1. Auto-detect: Check if var index values look like Ensembl IDs (`ENSG`/`ENSMUSG` prefix). If not, auto-switch to treating them as gene symbols.
2. Dual-column support: For datasets with both gene symbols and Ensembl IDs, allow specifying both.
3. Pre-existing `mt` column: Skip recalculation if the column already exists.

### BioNeMo

#### Sample finetune data
- Downloaded BLAT_ECOLX_Tenaillon2013 (beta-lactamase fitness landscape, 989 sequences, 80/20 train/eval split) from [SWAT repo](https://github.com/ziul-bio/SWAT) (MIT License)
- Uploaded to `/Volumes/{catalog}/{schema}/bionemo/esm2/ft_data/`
- Added download step to `initialize.py` so future deployments auto-provision the data
- Original data: Jacquier et al., PNAS 2013

#### Placeholder paths fixed
- Job YAML defaults updated from `/Volumes/my_catalog/schema/volume/folder/...` to `${var.core_catalog_name}/${var.core_schema_name}` variable interpolation
- Notebook widget defaults cleared of hardcoded developer paths
- Files: `bionemo_finetune_esm.yml`, `bionemo_inference_esm.yml`, `bionemo_esm_finetune.py`, `bionemo_esm_inference.py`

#### Inference fixes
- **Auto-detect output type**: Checks for `classification_output` or `regression_output` in results dict instead of trusting `task_type` parameter
- **Create result directory**: Added `os.makedirs(result_location, exist_ok=True)` before writing results
- **Task type help note**: Added help text to UI selectbox: "Must match the task type used during fine-tuning. If mismatched, the notebook will auto-detect from the model output."
- **bionemo_weights typo**: Fixed `mmt_bionemo_esm2_tinetune_test` → `mmt_bionemo_esm2_finetune_test` in table

---

### Boltz

#### PyTorch version mismatch
- `conda_env.yml` had `torch==2.3.1+cu121` but `transformers>=4.41` (from `dbboltz`) pulled in a version requiring torch>=2.4
- Logs showed: `"Disabling PyTorch because PyTorch >= 2.4 is required but found 2.3.1"`
- Fixed: Updated to `torch==2.4.1+cu121`, `torchvision==0.19.1+cu121`

#### Dependency pinning
- `transformers>=4.41,<4.50` and `sentence-transformers>=2.7,<3` pinned in both `dbboltz/pyproject.toml` and `conda_env.yml` to prevent future drift

#### Workload
- Bumped to `Medium` workload size for stability
- Model re-registered (v3) with updated deps

---

### SCimilarity

#### Per-endpoint workload configuration
Replaced shared `workload_type` job parameter with per-endpoint params:

| Endpoint | Workload Type | Workload Size | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| gene_order | CPU | Small | Only `setuptools` in pip_requirements — no torch, fast CPU build |
| get_embedding | MULTIGPU_MEDIUM | Small | NN inference needs GPU; scimilarity pulls torch transitively |
| search_nearest | MULTIGPU_MEDIUM | Small | scimilarity pulls torch (CPU builds slow); needs RAM with low concurrency |

**Why GPU for get_embedding and search_nearest?** All models depend on `scimilarity==0.4.0` which transitively pulls `torch` + `pytorch-lightning`. GPU serving environments have torch pre-cached in the base image → fast container builds. CPU serving works functionally but triggers a full torch install from scratch.

**Why Small concurrency for search_nearest?** Loads ~23M cell reference into RAM (~12GB per worker). Small (0-4 workers) fits in memory. Medium (0-16) OOMs.

#### Registration flow updated
```
01_wget_scimilarity (download model + sample data)
    ├── 02_register_GeneOrder
    ├── 03_register_GetEmbedding
    ├── 04_register_SearchNearest
    │       └── 05_importNserve_model_gwb (deploy endpoints)
    └── 06a_extractNsave_DiseaseCellTypeSamples (NEW)
```
- Added `extract_sample_data_task` (06a) — extracts IPF myofibroblast samples for endpoint testing
- Runs after `wget_SCimilarity_task` in parallel with register tasks

#### Notebook rename
- `05_import_model_gwb.py` → `05_importNserve_model_gwb.py` (reflects both import + serve)
- Task key: `update_model_catalog_scimilarity_models_task` → `importNserve_scimilarity_models_task`

#### Module README
- Created comprehensive `README.md` covering endpoints, workload rationale, job flow, parameters, notebooks, data structure, and dependencies

#### 06b endpoint testing notebook updates
- Replaced `databricks_instance` / REST API calls with `WorkspaceClient()` SDK-based endpoint queries
- Removed `databricks_instance` widget and markdown references
- Fixed pip install: `numcodecs[crc32c]==0.13.1`
- Dynamic arrow offsets for UMAP visualization (no hardcoded coordinates)
- Added `start_stop_check_endpoints (all endpoints).py` helper for waking all endpoints

---

### Model Serving (all endpoints)

#### AI Gateway configuration

All GWB model serving endpoints currently have no inference tables configured. To enable AI Gateway with inference tables on new endpoints, use `AiGatewayConfig`:

```python
from databricks.sdk.service.serving import AiGatewayConfig, AiGatewayInferenceTableConfig

ai_gateway_config = AiGatewayConfig(
    inference_table_config=AiGatewayInferenceTableConfig(
        catalog_name=catalog_name,
        schema_name=schema_name,
        table_name_prefix=f"{endpoint_name}_serving",
        enabled=True,
    ),
)
```

Pass `ai_gateway=ai_gateway_config` to `w.serving_endpoints.create_and_wait()`.

For **existing endpoints**, enable via:
```python
w.serving_endpoints.put_ai_gateway(
    name=endpoint_name,
    inference_table_config=AiGatewayInferenceTableConfig(
        catalog_name=catalog_name,
        schema_name=schema_name,
        table_name_prefix=f"{endpoint_name}_serving",
        enabled=True,
    ),
)
```

`models.py` has been updated with `AiGatewayConfig` / `AiGatewayInferenceTableConfig` imports and commented-out config blocks ready to enable, replacing legacy `AutoCaptureConfigInput`.

---

### MLflow Experiments

#### Two-path design
| Path | Base | Purpose | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| System-level | `/Shared/dbx_genesis_workbench_models/` | Model registration artifacts | Deploy-time (admin, one-time) |
| User-level | `/Users/<email>/<mlflow_experiment_folder>/` | User workflow results | App UI (every user run) |

The folder name (default `mlflow_experiments`) is configurable in the app's Profile page.

### Post-Deploy Verification

Verification scripts were used to validate the deployment — checking all jobs (ON_DEMAND), endpoints (READY), volumes, app, tables, and groups. These are workspace-specific (hardcoded job IDs, endpoint names) and kept in the local deployment logs at `docs/deployments/fe-vm-hls-amer/` (gitignored). When deploying to a new workspace, create a workspace-specific copy with updated IDs and paths.
