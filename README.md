Generative AI is reshaping the life sciences. Foundation models trained on genomics, protein structures, molecular interactions, and cellular behaviors are unlocking capabilities that weren't possible a few years ago:

- **Foundation models across every domain** — From DNA to proteins to single cells to small molecules, there's now a pretrained model for almost every biological modality. Teams can start from these and fine-tune on their own data instead of training from scratch.
- **Drug discovery acceleration** — Generative AI compresses months of wet-lab iteration into hours of in-silico screening, candidate ranking, and hypothesis generation. Lead time on early-stage discovery drops by an order of magnitude.
- **Higher-accuracy structure prediction** — Tools like AlphaFold, ESMFold, and Boltz predict 3D structure from sequence with previously unattainable accuracy, opening up targets that were structurally inaccessible.
- **Personalized medicine** — Patient-specific modeling of therapeutic responses is moving from research curiosity to clinical reality, enabling precision treatment decisions at the individual level.
- **Knowledge synthesis at scale** — LLMs specialized in biomedical literature surface insights buried in millions of papers, accelerating hypothesis generation and reducing duplicated work.

## $${\color{orange}Challenges}$$

Despite the breakthroughs, the experts who can apply these models — biologists, geneticists, biochemists — spend most of their time on tasks far outside their training:

- **GPU and CUDA infrastructure** — Days spent configuring drivers, toolkits, and CUDA-compatible PyTorch builds before a single inference can run.
- **Workflow orchestration** — Stitching together data prep, training, evaluation, and serving pipelines requires software-engineering skills the biology curriculum doesn't cover.
- **Data engineering and governance** — Collecting, cleaning, and integrating heterogeneous biological datasets under privacy and reproducibility constraints is a full-time job in itself.
- **Model serving and lifecycle** — Even after training, productionizing a model — registry, endpoints, monitoring, retraining — is yet another discipline the scientist has to pick up.
- **Time stolen from the science** — Every hour spent on infrastructure is an hour not spent on biology. The slower the loop, the slower the innovation.

## $${\color{orange}Genesis}$$ $${\color{orange}Workbench}$$

Genesis Workbench is an open-source, Databricks-native blueprint that packages biological foundation models behind an intuitive UI — so scientists can run them without managing GPU clusters, CUDA, model registries, or serving endpoints.

### AI-Assisted Workflow Generation

**Use the workbench declaratively — describe the science you want and get a runnable pipeline, no wiring or boilerplate.** This lowers the barrier from "I know how to build this" to "I know what I want", so more scientists can turn ideas into experiments and innovate faster. **Vortex** is the visual canvas that makes it happen.

- **Compose visually** — wire deployed endpoints, prebuilt workflows, transforms, and data IO into one pipeline; each input is editable inline or fed from an upstream node.
- **Generate from a goal** — an Agent drafts the workflow and streams its reasoning, then **self-reviews and repairs** its own draft (dangling nodes, dead-end outputs, type-mismatched wiring, pipelines that miss the goal).
- **Wire deterministically** — every port publishes its value *shape*, so extraction paths are derived (not guessed); when a value can't be produced directly, the one bridging node is auto-inserted or the run is rejected at submit with a clear reason.
- **Validate before running** — a live checklist flags every unconnected input or bad value; Run stays gated until the graph is runnable.
- **Track, inspect & re-run** — **Past Vortex Runs** shows each run's workflow·inputs·outputs and elapsed time; re-run with edited inputs from a side drawer; failed runs get an AI root-cause/fix + data-vs-system verdict beside the real stack trace.
- **Fail loudly on bad data** — a step that resolves to null fails the run instead of producing a meaningless result.

### MCP Support

**Genesis Workbench becomes a work horse for the broader AI ecosystem** — its models and workflows become tools any agent or MCP client can call, so the platform powers your assistants and pipelines instead of living in a silo. A companion **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** (`mcp-genesis-workbench`) exposes it to the Databricks AI Playground, Claude, Cursor, or your own agents; deployed automatically with `core`.

- **Endpoints & workflows as tools** — `endpoint_<name>` runs synchronously and returns predictions; `workflow_<name>` dispatches a job and returns a run id to poll.
- **Discoverable** — `list_capabilities` and `get_workflow_run_status` round out the surface; streamable HTTP at `/mcp`.
- **Same core as Vortex** — reuses the shared capability/executor code, so an MCP call runs the identical path as the UI.
- **Governed** — runs as its own service principal, so every call stays attributable.

### Components

**Get started fast with prepackaged models and workflows — and clear patterns to customize and extend them with your own.**

- **Pre-packaged biological models** ready to deploy: ESMFold, AlphaFold2, ProteinMPNN, RFDiffusion, scGPT, SCimilarity, Scanpy, rapids-singlecell (part of scverse), ChemProp, DiffDock, Boltz, NVIDIA Parabricks, NVIDIA BioNeMo and more.
- **Tailored workflows** for protein design, drug discovery, single-cell analysis, and variant analysis — each surfaced as a UI tab with sane defaults.
- **Built on Databricks primitives**: Asset Bundles, Workflows, Model Serving, MLflow, Unity Catalog, and Databricks Apps — so everything you run is governed, reproducible, and traceable.
- **Modular and extensible**: each capability is an independent module that can be deployed and destroyed independently.

## $${\color{orange}Modules}$$

Each module is independently deployable with `./deploy.sh <module> <cloud>`. Click through to the workflow deep-dives for inputs, outputs, models, and example runs.

### Single Cell
Single-cell RNA-seq at scale. Run end-to-end pipelines on millions of cells with Scanpy or GPU-accelerated rapids-singlecell (part of scverse). Annotate cell types per cluster against SCimilarity's 23M-cell reference database, search published studies for similar cells, and predict the effect of gene knockouts or overexpression with scGPT. The interactive results viewer offers UMAP exploration, differential expression, pathway enrichment, and trajectory analysis on the same run.

**Models bundled:** scGPT, SCimilarity, Scanpy, rapids-singlecell (part of scverse), Merck TEDDY-G 400M (joint cell-type + disease annotation)

### Large Molecule
Protein structure prediction, design, and engineering. Fold proteins in seconds with ESMFold or at high accuracy with AlphaFold2; design novel backbones with RFDiffusion + ProteinMPNN; redesign sequences for a fixed backbone (inverse folding) with ProteinMPNN and validate each design by re-folding with ESMFold; run BLAST-like searches across 150M+ sequences using ESM-2 embeddings. The **Guided Enzyme Optimization** workflow chains Proteina-Complexa, ProteinMPNN, ESMFold, Boltz, NetSolP, PLTNUM, DeepSTABp, and MHCflurry into a reward-weighted scaffold-and-score loop that surfaces variants ranked on motif fidelity, fold confidence, optional substrate complex, and four developability axes (solubility, anchor-relative half-life, melting temperature, immunogenic burden).

**Models bundled:** ESMFold, ESM-2 Embeddings, AlphaFold2, ProteinMPNN, RFDiffusion, Boltz

### Small Molecule
Drug-discovery essentials. Generate novel candidate molecules from a seed scaffold or binding motif with **GenMol** in a hard-constraint generate→score→reseed loop (**Guided Molecule Design**), profile candidates for drug-like properties and toxicity with ChemProp, predict protein-ligand binding poses with DiffDock, design protein binders to a target protein or small molecule with Proteina-Complexa, and transplant functional motifs into new scaffolds. Fine-tune **KERMT** (NVIDIA-BioNeMo's Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task GNN) on your own ADMET/tox assay and serve it side-by-side with ChemProp. Each generated candidate can be scored on developability through NetSolP (solubility), PLTNUM-ESM2 (relative half-life), DeepSTABp (melting temperature), and MHCflurry (immunogenic burden).

**Models bundled:** GenMol, KERMT, ChemProp, DiffDock, Proteina-Complexa, NetSolP-1.0, PLTNUM-ESM2, DeepSTABp, MHCflurry 2.x

### Genomics
Variant analysis at population scale. Call germline variants from FASTQ files with GPU-accelerated NVIDIA Parabricks, ingest VCFs into Delta tables for fast SQL/Spark queries, run genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using Glow, and annotate variants with ClinVar clinical-significance data. Inline interactive charts in the UI break down findings by gene, ACMG category, clinical significance, and zygosity.

**Components:** NVIDIA Parabricks variant calling, Glow GWAS, Spark VCF→Delta ingestion, ClinVar annotation

### NVIDIA BioNeMo
NVIDIA's generative AI framework for digital biology. The optional BioNeMo module ships container definitions and workflows that expose pre-trained BioNeMo models, starting with ESM-2 fine-tuning and inference. It also hosts the **KERMT** fine-tune workflow (Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task — a small-molecule ADMET GNN), whose served endpoint is compared side-by-side with ChemProp in the Small Molecule ADMET tab. Containers are optimized for NVIDIA hardware and integrated into Genesis Workbench's job system, MLflow registry, and model-serving infrastructure.

## $${\color{orange}Installation}$$

Full step-by-step setup is in the [Installation Guide](Installation.md). Quick path (assumes Databricks CLI authenticated to the target workspace as DEFAULT profile):

```bash
# 1. Deploy core first (UI, infrastructure, settings tables)
./deploy.sh core <aws|azure|gcp>

# 2. Deploy each module — one at a time, wait for jobs to finish before the next
./deploy.sh large_molecule  <aws|azure|gcp>
./deploy.sh single_cell     <aws|azure|gcp>
./deploy.sh small_molecule  <aws|azure|gcp>
./deploy.sh genomics        <aws|azure|gcp>
./deploy.sh bionemo         <aws|azure|gcp>   # optional, requires BioNeMo container build
```

For UI-only redeploys after the initial install (preserves all settings tables — never use `deploy.sh core` on a populated install):

```bash
cd modules/core
./update.sh <cloud> --ui-only   # rebuilds frontend, redeploys app, skips secret refresh / grants / UC volume copy
```

## $${\color{orange}What's}$$ $${\color{orange}Included}$$

Genesis Workbench ships open models and open datasets across all modules. Models are registered as Databricks Model Serving endpoints (or run as batch jobs); datasets are downloaded/ingested once into Unity Catalog so the app has **no runtime external-API dependency**.
